# Back-End-Simple-Search-Task
This is a simple search task, hit an endpoint containing the list of hotels and perform some actions on the result.


## Note:
More of this actions can be done using frontend javaScript, like search, and order. But I built all things in backend, Only, to meet the requirement.
